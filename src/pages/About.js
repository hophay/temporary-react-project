        Umbrellas Restaurant and Bar was originally conceptualized to be a casual beach bar, with delicious and easy food, amazing cocktails created with Westerhall Rums - all with the goal of an atmosphere that spreads good times and vibes. Years before Umbrellas existed, one of the owner's mother had a small bar named "The Umbrella Bar" which operated at the same location. This inspired the name, and expanded the story and evolution of what is now today Umbrellas.

Umbrellas Restaurant and Bar was created as a form of the Westerhall Rums experience. The brand wanted a location that it could share its products  in an exciting way - what other way than a beach side restaurant and bar emulating the epitome of Caribbean culture by way of the beach, good rum, and good vibes.
